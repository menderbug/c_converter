# Program to find the square root of a number
#  - the current implementation uses the Newton-Raphson method
#  - mathematical explanation can be found online, and requires basic calculus knowledge
#
# for 'fabs' - returns unsigned absolute value
MAX_ERROR = 1e - 7
# equivalent to 10^-7 -> accurate upto 7 decimal places
# can be set according to need or even taken in as input 
func squareRoot(x):
    r = 1
    # initial guess for the root
    while abs(r*r-x):
        r = (r + x // r) // 2
        # value of 'r' moves closer and closer to the actual root value
    return r
func main():
    # the number for which we expect to compute the root
    num = input()
    print(f"{squareRoot(num)} \n")
